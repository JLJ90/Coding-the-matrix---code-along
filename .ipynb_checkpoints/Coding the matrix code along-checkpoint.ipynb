    "I am a PhD student In Food science of all things, and I have become obsessed with with all things data and IT. In 2019 this means machine learning. I have become and expert on kaggle and have taken most of the courses, so I am not a beginner when it comes to machine learning. However, I think that a deep-dive into the theory of linear algebra, and a bit more into statistics will help me. \n",

    "I do not have any specific qualifications in mathematics past my school days. I did take a statistics course and maths course as part of my food science degree, but it was fairly fundamental, and contained no linear algebra. I got as far as the chain rule in calculus and two-way ANOVA in statistics.\n",
